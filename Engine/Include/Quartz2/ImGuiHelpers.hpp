	 * @class BaseImWindow
	 * @brief An ancestor / base class for Object Oriented ImGui Windows.
	 *
	 * @detailed
	 *   This ImGui helper class is meant to be a base used to build Object
	 *   Oriented ImGui graphical elements. This is particularly useful when
	 *   trying to create alternatively styleable UI elements. All of the
	 *   classes' functions as per ImGui standard are defined inline by
	 *   default for performance. Initially this was actually made as a
	 *   workaround for ImGui's styling limitations given it's architecture:
	 *   ImGui can only use inline styling.
	 *
	 *   @code
	 *   //This is what I mean; this is the only way to restyle / recolor
	 *   //elements in ImGui outside modifying the global style.
	 *   ImGui::PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol_XXXX, IM_COL32(r,g,b,a));
	 *   //draw a widget or window...
	 *   ImGui::PopStyleColor( none or num of color edits to undo );
	 *   @endcode
	 *
	 *   Although there are other uses for this outside styling such as
	 *   event processing.
	 *
	 *   @note
	 *   This isn't absolutely necessary for styling, but I find separating
	 *   the style logic from the operational logic good for code readability.
	 *
	 *   ###Usage Example:
	 *   Below is an example using this ancestor in practice implemening
	 *   a restylable widget and making a recolor. This has the same effect
	 *   as writing two different functions thanks to inlining, but more of
	 *   the code gets reused as a result. And because there are no method
	 *   abstractions trying to handle the colors, there's no loss in
	 *   performance; with the exception of the virtual function's runtime
	 *   type checker to direct the draw methods to their correct inherited
	 *   functions, but this is negligible in comparison.
	 *
	 *   @note
	 *   The above statement regarding inline optimizations may not be
	 *   correct with all compilers because it's up to the compiler how
	 *   inlining is handled. Thus the performance gains while safe to
	 *   assume true in most scenarios, will not be true in all.
	 *
	 *   @code
	 *   // Basic def for the Object Oriented window we'll be augmenting.
	 *   class ComplexWidget : public BaseImWindow {
	 *   protected:
	 *     const char* firstChildName;
	 *     const char* secondChildName;
	 *     inline void firstChild(ImGuiWindowFlags flags){
	 *       std::string name = std::string(rootWindowName)
	 *                                      .append("_Output");
	 *       ImGui::BeginChild(name.c_str(), flags);
	 *       ImGui::TextWrapped("%s", "first child");
	 *       ImGui::EndChild();
	 *     };
	 *     inline void secondChild(ImGuiWindowFlags flags){
	 *       std::string name = std::string(rootWindowName)
	 *                                      .append("_Output");
	 *       auto ursa = std::string("A uniquely !red stuff and major");
	 *       ImGui::BeginChild(name.c_str(), flags);
	 *       ImGui::TextWrapped("%s", ursa.c_str());
