		 * @brief Generation and Rendering manager for the "world".
		 *
		 * The ChunkManager handles generation of new chunks as you wander
		 * around as well as the rendering of these chunks using a ChunkRenderer
		 * object.
		 *
		 * The ChunkManager requires a position to be sent in each tick event,
		 * however it should be kept in mind that the "Camera" position and the
		 * voxel-world space coordinates are INCOMPATIBLE. This is due to the
		 * vertices required by the rendering system. The tick function
		 * currently automates the process of converting the camera position
		 * into the world space coordinates, however this should be phased out
		 * in the future and made much more explicit, just to be on the safer
		 * side.
		 *
		 * @paragraph Usage
		 * @code
		 * ChunkManager world(viewDistance);
		 *
		 * mainGameLoop()
		 * {
		 *     camera.tick(dt);
		 *
		 *     world.tick(camera.getPosition());
		 *
		 *     world.render();
		 * }
		 * @endcode

			 * camera coordinates to voxel coordinates is done internally. This
			 * needs to be repaired and done explicitly through external code.

			 * @todo Create classes to solve said issue, decide on whether to rely on explicit or implicit conversion of coordinate systems.
