	 * @brief The Pipeline through which basic rendering occurs.
	 *
	 * This class provides the ability to use shaders while rendering - and
	 * you need shaders to render anything more than a triangle so this is a
	 * necessity. Shaders must be written with ambiguous location parameters
	 * on inputs but will be set through this class, to allow for maximum
	 * compatibility.
	 *
	 * The activate method must be called before rendering the system
	 * associated with this pipeline, otherwise you may render without or
	 * with the wrong shaders.
	 *
	 * The set* methods are to set uniform data, for example the MVP
	 * matrices from the camera.
	 *
	 * @paragraph Usage
	 * @code
	 * // using the chunk renderer as an example.
	 * ShaderPipeline pipeline;
	 * pipeline.prepare("myvert.shader", "myfrag.shader",
	 * ChunkRenderer::getRequiredShaderLayout());
	 *
	 * mainGameLoop()
	 * {
	 *     // individually activate since we have another shader that could be
	 *     // active.
	 *     pipeline.activate();
	 *	   pipeline.setMatrix(myViewMatrix);
	 *     pipeline.setMatrix(myProjectionMatrix);
	 *     world.render();
	 *
	 *     // lets say we made this for a ui element
	 *     pipeline2.activate();
	 *     ui.render();
